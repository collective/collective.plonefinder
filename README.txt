collective.plonefinder
======================


Ajax popup to reference plone contents.

This code is an extraction of plonearticle explorer for referencables contents
The intention is to make it usable for any content type in different situations :

- for referencable fields with a special widget (collective.orderrefswidget which will come later)

- for collective.ckeditor (in developpement) or any possible wysiwyg editor for referencing images or contents inside a rich text field,
  it's also possible to upload files / images and create folders with this product (big part of code taken from collective.uploadify)

- for links fields (as remoteUrl in ATLink) to reference internal links   
  

Don't use it in a production site for now (this product is under developpement)

This work has been started by Christophe Bosse & Jean-mat Grimaldi in 2007 for PloneArticle product. 

   
HOW TO USE IT  :
----------------
   
See the collective.ckeditor product as example.
You can also easily use it with another editor.
