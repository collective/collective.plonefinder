collective.plonefinder
======================

Ajax popup to browse and select plone contents, suitable to any
``plone.formilb`` form (portlets, control panels, ...)

This code is an extraction with some refactoring, of PloneArticle explorer used
for referencables proxies.

The intent is to make it usable in various situations:

- to store selected contents in ``plone.formlib`` based Plone forms (portlet or
  control panel forms as example)

- for ``collective.ckeditor`` or any possible wysiwyg editor for referencing
  images or contents inside a rich text field, it's also possible to upload
  files / images and create folders with this product (dependency to
  ``collective.quickupload``)

- for referencable fields inside AT edit forms (future)

- for links fields (as remoteUrl in ATLink) to reference internal links (future)

This work has been started at Ingeniweb in 2007 by Christophe Bosse (for the
jQuery code) and Jean-Mat Grimaldi (everything else) for PloneArticle product.

.. admonition::
   Plone add-ons developers only

   This is a component for Plone add-ons developers. Do not expect to add
   anything more in yous site if you install only this component to your Zope
   instance.

Plone 5.2 and later support is in 2.x releases.

Plone 4.3 support in 1.x releases.

Requirements
============

* Plone (tested with Plone 3.3.5 and Plone 4)
* collective.quickupload

Installation
============

* Nothing to do if you have installed ``collective.ckeditor`` (Plone 4 only
  today)

* Otherwise install it as any Zope package using buildout :

  - add ``collective.plonefinder`` in your ``eggs`` section

  - add ``collective.plonefinder`` in your ``zcml`` section of the
    ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` part definition if on Plone 3.0 or 3.1

  - Run ``bin/buildout``

Nothing else.

How to use it as a reference widget in formlib forms
====================================================

Basic usage
-----------

A reference widget for zope3 forms (zope.app.form) is provided with this product.

The widget can be used to store objects references in a sequence field.

Example of use in a portlet form for a Tuple field named target_contents::

    from collective.plonefinder.widgets.referencewidget import FinderSelectWidget

    target_contents = schema.Tuple(title=u"Browse for contents",
                                   description=(u"Choose contents to display "
                                                u"with a plone finder window."),
                                   default=()
                                   )

    form_fields['target_contents'].custom_widget = FinderSelectWidget

Tweaking some properties
------------------------

You can use the ``FinderSelectWidget`` with some properties set using the update
method in your ``AddForm`` or ``EditForm``. In example for a portlet ``AddForm``::

    class AddForm(base.AddForm):
        """Portlet add form.
        """
        form_fields = form.Fields(IReferencesPortlet)
        form_fields['targets'].custom_widget = FinderSelectWidget
        label = u"Add References Portlet"

        def update(self):
            super(AddForm, self).update()
            self.widgets['targets'].typeview = 'image'
            self.widgets['targets'].forcecloseoninsert = 1

        def create(self, data):
            return Assignment(**data)

If you want, you can also pass a context as base for the widget, to get the
current or parent folder open in the finder. Example in a portlet using the
``update`` method::

        assignment = aq_parent(aq_inner(self.context))
        self.widgets['targets'].base = aq_parent(aq_inner(assignment))

There are also two customized widgets for files and images. Look at the code to
create your own specific widget.

Example of code for files referencing with files upload support::

    from collective.plonefinder.widgets.referencewidget import FinderSelectFileWidget

    target_files = schema.Tuple(title=u"Browse for images",
                                description=(u"Choose files to display "
                                             u"with a plone finder window. "
                                             u"You can upload new files."),
                                default=()
                                )

    form_fields['target_files'].custom_widget = FinderSelectFileWidget

Example of code for images referencing with images upload support::

    from collective.plonefinder.widgets.referencewidget import FinderSelectImageWidget

    target_images = schema.Tuple (title=u"Browse for images",
                                  description=(u"Choose images to display "
                                               u"with a plone finder window. "
                                               u"You can select different image sizes. "
                                               u"You can upload new images."),
                                  default= ()
                                  )

    form_fields['target_images'].custom_widget = FinderSelectImageWidget

Note that in this last case the data store image uid and image thumb size like
this::

    '%s/%s' % (image.UID(), thumb_size_extension)

``thumb_size_extension`` could be ``'image_thumb'`` or ``'image_preview'`` ...

So use something like this to display a referenced image::

    uid, variant = data.split('/')
    '<img src="%s/resolveuid/%s/%s" />' % (portal_url, uid, variant)

       possible value is ``'url'``.
   * - ``showsearchbox``
     - ``True``
     - Do we show the searchbox?
   * - ``allowupload``
     - ``False``
     - Do we enable upload files through our widget if the user has appropriate
       permission? See `Uploadding in custom folderish type`_
   * - ``openuploadwidgetdefault``
     - ``False``
     - Do we display the upload widget by default?
   * - ``allowaddfolder``

   * - ``base``
     - ``None``
     - The folderish object used as root of the finder when opening. ``None``
       means the Plone site. **Note that** by nature, this attribute cannot be
       set statically, in a ``FinderSelectWidget`` personal subclass for example
       as other can be. See the example in simple customizations on how to
       change the widget ``base`` attribute dynamically from the form class
       code.


Developer Howto
===============

How to use it in a WYSIWYG editor
---------------------------------

The more easy way is creating a specific view, because you will often need to
override the javascript method to select objects, and because each editor has
its specific negociations with the browser.

See ``collective.ckeditor`` package as example.


Uploadding in custom folderish type
-----------------------------------

If you want to let the plone finder users upload files in your custom or third
party folderish content types, you need to mark these types with the
``IFinderUploadCapable`` marker interface. As in this self-speaking ZCML
sample::

  <class class="my.content.folderish.MyFolderish">
    <implements
       interface="collective.plonefinder.browser.interfaces.IFinderUploadCapable" />
  </class>

Out of the box, ``collective.plonefinder`` enables upload in the Plone site
itself as well as in ``ATFolder`` and ``ATBTreeFolder``.

Todo
====

- Functional doctests

- i18n support

- Finder improvements:

  - Ajax opening/moving/resizing and all window effects inside the same browser
    window (in progress, need some js refactoring)

  - improve contextual actions menu (change workflow state, rename, delete,
    copy, paste ...)

  - add a finder menu action to show/hide the current selection list in right
    panel

  - remove items from selection list in finder window

- Improve zope3 reference widget properties

  - add option to hide/show or just mark selected items in finder browsing
    results (just need to store the finder blacklist in session)

  - add option to set a specific catalog query stored in session

  - add option to change finder catalog.

- New zope3 widget to store urls (for a string field)

- Archetypes support:

  - ATPloneFinderWidget for Reference fields (not a big challenge, just need to
    use ATReferenceBrowserWidget as base to start the work)

  - ATLinkWidget to store internal links

- Dexterity support (z3c.form)

- Supplement ``types`` and ``imagetypes`` attributes with others uning
  interfaces for a better flexibility.

- Provide as parameter a factory that provides the results in the desired
  format. i.e You need a particular attribute of the target or some computed
  value.

- Componentize the code for more flexibility.
